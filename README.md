Personal Finance Dashboard Project
The Personal Finance Dashboard is an interactive tool developed using Power BI to provide real-time tracking and visualization of personal financial data. It consolidates multiple data sources, offering a holistic view of users' income, expenses, and savings, empowering them to make informed financial decisions and improve budgeting habits.
The dashboard categorizes income into primary and secondary sources, while expenses are organized into key areas such as house rent, EMIs, groceries, leisure, health, and shopping. Savings are broken down into mutual funds (MF), fixed deposits (FD), liquid cash, and emergency funds, allowing users to monitor and plan their financial goals effectively.
Through dynamic visualizations and intuitive layouts, the dashboard simplifies financial analysis, highlighting trends and patterns that aid better decision-making. This project emphasizes functionality and user engagement, showcasing the potential of data visualization in fostering financial literacy and management.
